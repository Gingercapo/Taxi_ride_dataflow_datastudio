# Task 2. Create a Cloud Storage bucket
In this task, I created a Cloud Storage bucket to provide working space for your Dataflow pipeline.

Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. I can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

In the Cloud console, in the Navigation menu (Navigation Menu), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.
    Click Create Bucket.
    For Name, copy and paste in your Project ID, and then click Continue.
    For Location type, click Multi-region if it is not already selected.
    Click Create.
